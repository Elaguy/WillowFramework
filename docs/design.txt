WillowSUD (single user-dungeon rpg)
-----------------------------------

CURRENT VERSION: 0.2i (i for in-development)

********************************************************************
The WillowFramework will not necessarily have all of these features.
Instead, a WillowSUD project will be created and the code from
WillowFramework copied. Same with a WillowMUD project.
So, essentially, WillowFramework is the backbone for these two
projects.
********************************************************************

CLASSES IN DETAIL:

- World
A world is defined by a 15 x 20 2D array, which holds all of
the elements of the world for display.

When the world needs to be displayed, it sends the world
information to the Display class.

World is the class that does most of the work.

- Player
This class creates a new Player object, which is used to place
a player into the world. The player has:
   - A location (a row number and a column number)
   - A name
   - Skill levels (1 to 100)
   - An inventory
   - A currently wielded item: A player can only wield one
   item unless it is a shield along with some kind of
   weapon
   - Currently worn items: A player can wear a maximum of 5
   items that can be worn
   - HP (health points): All players start with 100 HP.
   Wearing armor helps hits from monsters to be less
   effective. If a player's HP reaches 0, the player dies,
   and the current game ends
   
- Monster (abstract)
This class creates a new Monster object, which is used to place
a monster into the world. A monster (regardless of the type):
  - Spawns in a random square at game start and walks around 1
  square each turn in a random direction
  - (For now) Doesn't attack the player unless the player attacks
  the monster
  - When a monster dies, an object is chosen at random and is dropped
  at the square the monster occupied before it died.
Types of monsters:
  - Goblins
  
- Item
This class creates a new Item object, which is used to place an
item into the world. An item has (regardless of the type):
  - A name
  - A value
  - A type
  - A location (row and column numbers)
  
- Skills
This class lists the skills available in the game, the
XP gained from a skill activity, and the amount of XP
necessary to advance to the next level
